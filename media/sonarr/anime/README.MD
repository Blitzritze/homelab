# I AM USING THE CUSTOM FORMATS FROM [TRASH GUIDES](https://trash-guides.info/). HOWEVER, I HAVE CUSTOMIZED SOME SETTINGS.

*[CF's](<custom format>) that you don't find here are from Trash Guides and can be found [here](https://trash-guides.info/Sonarr/sonarr-collection-of-custom-formats/)*

*My settings are configured for dual German/Japanese or German/Chinese audio.
If no dual audio is available, only German audio will be searched for. If no German audio is found, the original dubbing will be used, either in Japanese or Chinese with multiple subtitles, or with German subtitles.*
